## 📌 Project Overview

**CityPulse** is an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes the intersection of **urban traffic congestion** and **air pollution levels (AQI)** across six futuristic smart cities.

It reveals:
- **Hourly traffic trends**
- **City-wise AQI patterns**
- **Time-of-day vs pollution correlations**

🧠 Use the slicers to filter insights by:
- City
- Day
- AQI Category
- Time of Day

## 📊 Features

- 📈 **Dynamic Visuals**: Line charts, bar graphs, scatter plots, and cards
- 🕒 **Hourly Breakdown**: Time-based analysis of traffic & AQI
- 🏙️ **City Comparisons**: Multiple cities side-by-side
- 🧹 **Cleaned & Preprocessed Dataset**
- 🛠️ **No-code interaction with slicers and filters**
